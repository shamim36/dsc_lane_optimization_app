North Somerset Council's CCTV system currently operates a total of 360 cameras of which 309 are Public Space Surveillance cameras with a further 51 cameras which cover internal council properties. The cameras transmit data back to the control room in the Town Hall and are monitored 24 hours a day, 365 days a year by a team of fully trained operators at North Somerset Council's emergency control centre.

The operators have direct radio communication with the police, council enforcement officers, businesses. and street wardens. They deal with emergency out-of-hours calls to the council, lone worker monitoring and provide a dedicated operator for the night-time Carelink service.

The purpose of the CCTV system is to:

• help make the area safe for those people who live, work and trade in it and those who visit North Somerset.
• help to prevent, detect, and reduce crime and disorder in the area.
• reduce the fear of crime and provide reassurance to the public.
• assist in crime prevention, combat terrorism, helping to identify/apprehend/prosecute offenders and to provide the police and the
council with
evidence to take criminal and civil action in the courts.
• assist the local authority in its enforcement and regulatory functions within North Somerset.

The CCTV system throughout North Somerset undergoes an annual privacy impact assessment. The assessment makes sure that CCTV systems are being operated in accordance with the current legislation surrounding data protection. The CCTV operators also make sure the cameras remain fit for the original purpose for which they were installed.

A Data Protection Privacy Assessment on all public space surveillance cameras was carried out on 13th January 2023, the assessment determined that all public space CCTV cameras are fulfilling their original purpose, as detailed in the CCTV System Code of Practice (please see Useful Links).

We have received one complaint since the last assessment on 11 Nov 2021. This was regarding camera DI 57 Baker Street and the concern of intrusion into a property. Following this, the camera has been set up with privacy zones.

The CCTV system has been awarded the Surveillance Camera Commissioner's accreditation which demonstrates compliance with good practice and legislation.
